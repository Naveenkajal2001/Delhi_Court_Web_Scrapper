# Delhi_Court_Web_Scrapper
In this project, I built a Delhi High Court Case Status Web Scraper using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. The script automatically navigates the Delhi High Court case search page, extracts case details, fetches PDF links from secondary pages, and displays all data in a clean, structured format.
